I'm currently in my last year at Sindh Madrasatul Islam University (SMIU), where I'm pursuing a degree in BS Software. Throughout my academic journey at SMIU, I've delved into various programming languages and technologies. I've gained proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and React, expanding my skill set by taking additional courses. My experience extends beyond theoretical knowledgeâ€”I've actively contributed to diverse web projects, utilizing React to implement multifaceted functionalities across different websites.

Moreover, I'm deeply engaged in exploring the paradigm of Web 3.0 through comprehensive coursework at PIAIC, honing my understanding of its transformative potential. My passion for web development is evident in my practical applications, where I continually strive to innovate and enhance user experiences. I take pride in my ability to leverage React's capabilities to create dynamic and efficient web solutions, integrating functionality seamlessly.

My journey in software development, coupled with my education at SMIU, has been a dynamic fusion of academic learning and hands-on experience. This combination has propelled me to excel in the realm of web development. I am enthusiastic about contributing my skills and knowledge from Sindh Madrasatul Islam University to innovative projects and driving the future of web technology forward.
